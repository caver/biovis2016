\parttitle{Background} 
Protein function is determined by many factors, namely by its constitution, spatial arrangement, and dynamic behavior. 
Studying these factors helps the biochemists and biologists to better understand the protein behavior and to design proteins with modified properties.
One of the most common approaches to these studies is to compare the protein structure with other molecules and to reveal similarities and differences in their polypeptide chains.

%Visual comparison of molecular structures could provide domain experts with an important information about the similarities and differences in their protein chains. Information about the amino acids (AA) is typically conveyed via secondary structures or as a 1D sequence of AA forming the protein chain. 

\parttitle{Results} 
We support the comparison process by proposing a new visualization technique that bridges the gap between traditionally used 1D and 3D representations.
By introducing the information about mutual positions of protein chains into the 1D sequential representation the users are able to observe the spatial differences between the proteins without any occlusion commonly present in 3D view.
Our representation is designed to serve namely for comparison of multiple proteins or a set of time steps of molecular dynamics simulation.
%It aims to enhance the 1D sequential representation by adding parameters derived from geometry of secondary structures.
%The core of our technique is based on unrolling the protein chain to a line while maintaining the mutual orientation of secondary structures as well as their lengths. 
%Then the user can explore in detail structures of interest, which are visually compared via superimposition and juxtaposition techniques. 

\parttitle{Conclusions}  
The novel representation is demonstrated on two case studies.
The first study aims to compare a set of proteins from the family of cytochromes P450 where the position of the secondary structures has a significant impact on the substrate channeling.
The second study focuses on the protein flexibility when by comparing a set of time steps our representation helps to reveal the most dynamically changing parts of the protein chain.

\section*{Background}
Studying the structure of proteins has been in the scope of researchers for many decades, namely because of their importance in all living cells. 
Better understanding of their constitution and behavior helps to understand and control their function and properties.

Protein structure consists of a polypeptide chain of amino acids which is unique for each type of protein. 
The chain is folded into a spatial conformation which can possess specific patterns, called secondary structures.
Among these structures belong so called alpha-helices and beta-sheets. 
The amino acids forming these secondary structures are hold their shape thanks to weak hydrogen bonds between them.
Visual representation of the protein consisting of secondary structures is denoted as cartoon or ribbon (see Figure~\ref{fig:aquaria} left).
This highly abstracted visualization omits individual atoms of the protein and highlights only the protein backbone represented by the secondary structures.
Such a representation is very popular by researchers because of its balanced tradeoff between the level of abstractness and conveying the spatial arrangement of the chain.

\begin{figure*}[th]

  \caption{Left -- cartoon representation of the DhaA haloalkane dehalogenase (PDB ID 1CQW). Right -- part of the sequential representation of DhaA along with the information about secondary structures and several other structures sequentially aligned to DhaA. Images generated using the Aquaria tool by O'Donoghue et al.~\cite{odonoghue2015}.}
  \label{fig:aquaria}
\end{figure*}

When comparing several protein structures, e.g., when searching for similar structures in order to get the information about an unknown protein, there are several existing algorithms for aligning such structures.
These algorithms are aligning the whole structures (structure alignment) or are parsing the sequence of amino acids and searching for corresponding patterns (sequence alignment). 
The results of these alignments are traditionally presented in a form of color-coded one-dimensional sequential information (see Figure~\ref{fig:align}).
Each row represents one protein structure and the user can observe the similarities and differences between protein chains by exploring the columns.
Some methods equip the sequence with the information about secondary structures (see Figure~\ref{fig:aquaria} right).
However, all of them lack the mutual spatial orientation of the secondary structures of the aligned structures.
This information is crucial in many cases, namely when exploring the protein inner void space playing a significant role in protein reactivity with other molecules.
This void space is determined by the surrounding amino acids, i.e., secondary structures. 
Therefore, the changes in the spatial position of the secondary structures directly influence the volume and shape of the void space.

\begin{figure}[th]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{pics/align.png}
  \caption{Example of the sequence alignment visualization.}
  \label{fig:align}
\end{figure}

The mutual spatial arrangement of the secondary structures can be easily observed in a 3D view. 
However, for comparison of multiple proteins, such a representation is very limited with respect to its scalability.
In other words, due to the occlusion problems, the spatial representation is suitable for comparison of only few structures. 
Figure~\ref{fig:many} demonstrates the case when six similar proteins are aligned.
Even with such a small number of molecules it is hard to perceive the differences in the secondary structure positions.

%One of the most important ones is the presence of a void space inside the protein which directly influences the protein reactivity with a small ligand. 
%The interaction with the ligand occurs often deeply inside the protein and the

  \caption{Structure alignment of six proteins with similar structure visualized in 3D.}
  \label{fig:many}
\end{figure}

To overcome the problems of the lack of mutual arrangement of the compared protein in the sequential representation and problems with occlusion in the spatial view, we propose a new method designed to serve as a tool for comparison of multiple structures and intuitive exploration of their spatial differences.
It takes the advantages of the sequential information which consists of individual secondary structures and when comparing this sequence with other proteins, it encodes the mutual spatial arrangement of the secondary structures of the aligned proteins.
In consequence, the user can observe this arrangement without the occlusion problems of the 3D view.
Our solution also utilizes the fact that the domain experts are well accustomed with the sequential representation as well as with secondary structures and their cartoon representation. 
Therefore, our proposed visualization is interactively linked with the 3D view.
Selection of interesting secondary structures in the novel representation is directly projected to this spatial view.

\subsection*{Related Work}

An exhaustive and comprehensive review on the methods, tools and applications of 2D molecular graphics was presented by Zhou and Shang \cite{Zhou2009}. 
The review covers numerous approaches to generation and drawing of chemical structures, protein topology representation and schematic layout of molecular interactions.
The evaluation of common visualization techniques in context of their dimensionality is covered in the work of Heinrich \cite{Heinrich2014}.
The expected benefits and drawbacks of using manifold visualizations when solving particular tasks are discussed in order to propose ideas how to improve those techniques.

According to Stivala \cite{Stivala2011}, there are four systems specializing in automatic generation of protein structure diagrams.
One of the first was HERA \cite{Hutchinson1990}, which generates hydrogen bonding diagrams of protein structures and optionally helical wheels and helical nets.


All above-mentioned expert systems create these simplified topology maps from atomic co-ordinates in PDB files.


%HERA (Hutchinson and Thornton, 1990) generates detailed hydrogen-bonding diagrams
%TOPS generates topological cartoons with a “top-down” view in a style similar to the hand-drawn diagrams of Sternberg and Thornton (1977)
%A recent addition to the PDBsum website (Laskowski, PDBsum new things. 2009) generates topology diagrams for protein domains in an “exploded” style derived from HERA

\section*{Methodology}
Our newly proposed method bridges the gap between the one-dimensional and three-dimensional representations of the protein chain.
Moreover, it serves for fast and intuitive multiple comparison of proteins when it helps to reveal the similarities and differences between the aligned chains, namely their secondary structures.
The 3D representation is not suitable for such comparison because of the occlusion problems.
However, the spatial arrangement and mutual orientation of the aligned secondary structures highly influences the protein properties.
So it is desirable to communicate this information in the visualization.
On the other hand, the 1D sequential representation of the chain clearly communicates the protein constitution and removes the occlusion problem.
We also utilize the fact that the domain experts are well accustomed with both sequential and cartoon representations.
Therefore, we combined the qualities of both representations and proposed a novel method for comparison and interactive exploration of multiple aligned protein chains.

The input data consist of a set of proteins in the PDB format and are aligned with respect to their structure.
The alignment is performed using the Combinatorial Extension (CE) algorithm~\cite{Shindyalov1998}. 
One protein chain is selected as reference and the remaining proteins are aligned to it.
For each aligned protein this algorithm outputs the transformed positions of its atoms and the RMSD (root-mean-square deviation) number expressing the difference between the reference and aligned protein.  
The results are loaded to our newly proposed representation consisting of the following parts (see Figure~\ref{fig:design}):
\begin{itemize}
\item 3D visualization window showing all aligned proteins (it utilizes the PV viewer available in SWISS-MODEL tool~\cite{biasini2014})
\item superimposition and juxtaposition sequential representations of the secondary structures of aligned proteins
\end{itemize}

In the following we describe the design rationale behind the newly proposed sequential representation in detail.

\begin{figure*}[t!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{pics/element.png}
  \caption{Basic element of our proposed visualization consisting of two main parts. The top part shows the secondary structures of the aligned proteins, the bottom part serves for general overview and interactive navigation and selection.}
  \label{fig:element}
\end{figure*}

\subsection*{Design}
The design of the proposed sequential visualization is based on the following requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item it should convey the information about the constitution of the protein chain wrt. its secondary structures
\item it should serve for multiple comparison of protein chains in represented by its secondary structures
\item the user should be able to easily see the similarities and differences between the chains
\item the user should have the information about the global similarity between proteins 
\item the user should be able to interact with the system in order to explore the similarities and differences in detail
\end{itemize}

Figure~\ref{fig:element} shows the basic element of our proposed visualization.
It demonstrates the case when two proteins chains are aligned.
It consists of two main parts.
The main top part represents the sequential information about protein chain along with its secondary structures.
The bottom part serves for interactive navigation through the protein chain in the top part. 
It informs the user about the length and overall alignment of the compared structures.
Moreover, it enables the user to navigate through the chain and select only an interesting part of the aligned chains which is then zoomed in the top part.


The interactive navigation part consists several colored lines where each line corresponds to one protein.
If the protein consists of more chains, the line is interrupted.
Each line can contain black parts which correspond to gaps inserted by the overlay algorithm described in Section~\ref{sec:alg}.
These gaps play a role of inserted parts into the straightened chains in order to maintain the correspondence between secondary structures of aligned chains. 
This can happen, e.g., when one chain contains a secondary structure which is missing in the second protein (see Figure~\ref{fig:gap}).
In the top part each gap is represented by grey rectangle.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{pics/gap2.png}
  \caption{Example of a helix in the blue protein which does not have its couterpart in the orange protein. This is solved by inserting a gap (grey rectangle) to the superimposed and juxtaposed representations.}
  \label{fig:gap}
\end{figure}

These basic elements are used in two different manners.
In the first case all representations of the aligned chains are superimposed so the user can immediately see the most similar and different parts of the chains.
The second case shows all aligned chains next to each other which helps to explore individual chains in detail.
In both cases the user can use the navigation slider to select only and interesting part of the chains, zoom in and browse the chain in this zoomed mode.
In the visualization one protein, selected as a reference one, is completely straightened.
The orientation of the secondary structures in the remaining aligned chains is adjusted according to the difference between the position and rotation of the corresponding secondary structures in the reference chain (see Figure~\ref{fig:orientation}).

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{pics/orientation.png}
  \caption{Example of encoding the mutual orientation of two corresponding helices from the aligned chains (highlighted in green) into our representation. Our visualization maintains the information about the "opening" of the helices.}
  \label{fig:orientation}
\end{figure}

In consequence, our abstracted representation intuitively navigates the user to the most interesting parts of the chains by linking the selection in the superimposed or juxtaposed view with the 3D representation of the aligned proteins. 

As mentioned before, except for the visualization we proposed also an algorithm for solving the problem of gap insertion.
This will be described in detail in the following section.

%Strong points of our representation:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item interactive manipulation
%\item predefined ranking according to RMSD
%\item linking with 3D
%\item filtering (removing the most different proteins)
%\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Implementation}
Our system was implemented using web-based technologies in order to make it available to the wide community of potential users.
Therefore, we used JavaScript along with the D3.js library~\cite{d3} in order to create a fully interactive environment.
Our novel visualization is linked with the 3D representation of the aligned proteins which utilizes the PV viewer~\cite{biasini2014}. 

In the remaining part of this section we describe in detail our proposed algorithms for solving the problems with gap insertion into our visual representation.
We will outline the problem by using a metaphor when the protein chain can be taken as a thread and the secondary structures on this chain will correspond to beads put on this thread.
When comparing more protein chains, we are dealing with a set of threads. 
The beads on these threads can have different colors. 
Their color stands for one secondary structure (helix or strand) which has its unique structure, i.e., consists of a given set of amino acids.
Therefore, the beads with the same color can be positioned on different threads.
In other words, if two beads being on different threads have the same color, it signifies that the corresponding secondary structures were mutually aligned and marked as the corresponding ones. 
Now we take all the threads and put them below each other.
And the task is to position the beads on these threads in such a way that if they correspond to each other (have the same color), they are also positioned below each other. 
The following algorithm proposes a simple solution to this problem.

%With the use of the Combinatorial Extension (CE) algorithm for structure alignment~\cite{Shindyalov1998} and force layout algorithm, we let the structures to align in 3D, so there is no deformation caused by choosing a particular projection or distortion. 
%At the end, we visualize the flattened molecules as if they were stretched out from 3D by pulling the chosen reference molecule at its ends into a straight line, so the actual length of secondary structures is preserved as well as the position of near structures of other molecules which are “locked” to the reference molecule.

\subsubsection*{Gap Insertion Algorithm}
\label{sec:alg}
We may imagine molecule that contains structures as a thread with colored beads on it. 
Each of these two threads may or may not contain complete set of beads and these beads may not be in the same order. 
Beads may be moved along the thread but their order cannot change. 
From protein structure point of view we are interested in those parts where these two threads have not the same order of their beads or some beads are missing. 
We are searching for gaps in any of these two threads/protein chains. 
Imagine that you put both threads along each other and you are moving beads along the thread such a way to achieve the same color of beads to be aligned. 
The best solution would be to minimize the amount of gaps, respectively separated beads with no pair. 
%Thus the pair making basic algorithm. 
This requires a non trivial recursive algorithm that may be very costly for memory and computational time and its description will be only pseudo-coded here. 
We will reference this algorithm as Global Best Effort and its implementation is in the stage of optimization for purposes of molecule structure matchmaking. 
Our greedy approach takes simpler approach but already has promising results with acceptable running times.

\subsubsection{The Greedy Algorithm}
The main idea of this algorithm is to find gaps. 
The input for the algorithm is formed by two molecules. 
The output contains these two molecules with added gaps. 
The algorithm uses distance search and structure comparator. 
The idea for this algorithm comes from the double stack algorithm.
The algorithm runs until both molecules are fully traversed and uses per-step approach. 
In each step a secondary structure from at least one molecule has to be added to the output. 
!!!!!!!!!!If any gap happens, the progress on input molecules will not be the same, but as algorithm progress this may change and so.

\textbf{Match Making function}
Each matchmaking from molecule A to molecule B is done only from the current index of progress on each molecule. 
The molecules are traversed from the current index to the end of molecule. 
First match is returned. 
At the moment only distance in 3D and structure type are considered in matchmaking. 
In future, penalization for number of possible gaps will be added. 
Even though this penalization is already implemented in terms of first match. 
For Global Best Effort algorithm Match making function will have to take responsibility for best match finding.

In each step the algorithm decides what to include in output molecules and how to progress on input molecules. 
Algorithm holds progress in both input molecules.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item 
	If any molecule is already processed, fill output of that molecule with gaps and fill the other molecule with structures that left. 
	This may be imagined as filling the tail.
	\item  
	Find best matches from one molecule to another and vice versa, according to the match making function earlier. 
	Take match that has minimum gaps that is needed. 
	Now molecule A will represent the structure which pair has been found in molecule B. 
	Fill the output of molecule A with gaps in ratio 1:1 to structures that will be added to output of structure B. 
	Add structure from input A to output of molecule A and same in molecule B. 
	Progress input counter in molecule A by one and in molecule B by 1 + structures added to output of molecule B.   
  \item If no match is returned from both search add gap to molecule A and structure from molecule A to output of molecule A. 
	Add structure from molecule B and gap to molecule B. 
	Progress the counter on both molecules A and B.
	\item If both molecules are at end the solution has been found.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Dynamics}
Typically in dynamics we are comparing more than two molecules at same time. 
As seen earlier, Hunger and Best Effort algorithm modifies the output molecules. 
This is not acceptable in global scale as we may have to compare each molecule with each molecule and there is not a molecule that can not change. 
Another approach is required. 
As we only comparing same molecule in different time we are sure that structures will not change positions, even if they may be missing respectively not recognised in that time moment. Algorithm goes through all molecule time snapshots at each time. Algorithm takes all snapshots and returns one super snapshot without gaps but with all structures in order from beginning found in all snapshots. Algorithm holds position for each molecule snapshot.

If molecules are fully traversed end the solution.
For each snapshot (snapshot A):
Take current structure (structure A) and found that structure on each other snapshot (snapshot X). Traverse only nodes that are has not been already passed on traversed each structure (snapshot X). 
If GAP would be required. Do not search further and take another snapshot to take structure to find. Note that that in reality match will be found usually within 5 steps on chain so it is very rare to traverse whole molecule. (Time reduction)
If structures is found that do not require GAP (structure is missing in other snapshots or it is in first position to take) put it into an output super snapshot and progress on each structure where the structure has been found.
If for all snapshots GAP would be required to put (each snapshot would have to produce different structure on same position ... very unexpected ... maybe even impossible) take all snapshots and put all stuctures into super snapshot and update counter on each snapshot.

When this part of algorithm is ended. Run Hunger Algorithm with updated Match Making function. Match Making function will only take in count the structure type and not distance. From the experience we presume that the distance of the structures will not change that much to count with it. There is no need for Best Effort algorithm because the snapshots will be compared with super snapshot that has to encapsulate all snapshots. The super snapshot will no change so input of super snapshot will be the same as output for super snapshot from Hunger algorithm. 

On the final visuallisation gaps represent where are the dynamics points of interest. If no gaps are found the threshold for structure recognision may be too big and if many gaps are found the molecule may be instable or the threshold is set very strictly.
 

\subsection*{Interaction}

The 3D view and 2D view are both interactive -- basic information about the secondary structure is shown when mouse is moving over the visualizations and a structure is highlighted in green when a structure is selected by a mouse click. Moreover, the 3D and 2D views are interconnected, thus creating a unique way to explore the molecules -- when any of the structure is clicked on, the highlight is visible immediately in both views. This feature gives the user very important context of the actual spatial positions of the selected structures and enables him or her to interact with both views independtly, yet still in context. Therefore, the user does not have to tediously decode the flattened visualization trying to figure out what the spatial context of a given structure is, he or she just has to glipms into the 3D view and then continue to the next interesting area for exploration.

The visibility of molecules and their attributes in both views is possible via buttons in configuration panel below the 3D viewer. Molecules in the juxtaposition view are sortable, so the user can see the differences between the pairs of molecules of his or her choice.
